                    I am a full-stack web developer living in Chicago, and currently completing the coding boot camp at Northwestern University. I also have a background in applied mathematics, with a particular focus in spatial epidemiology, mathematical economics and differential equations. I love working with the back end of web applications and am excited to apply my coding skills, together with my background in mathematics, in the private sector after several years of teaching. For fun, I like to go on bike rides with my wife Kate.
